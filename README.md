# Xsplit_Broadcaster_Select_A_Chat
An Xsplit Broadcaster extension that allows the user to show individual YouTube live chat messages from viewers as stream source content.

# Issues
Extension does not support super chats.  
Creator pinned live chat message will break extension.  
Does not support changing the video ID in a properties menu, you must change the video ID in code.  

# Constraints  
This plugin is structured the way it is because I did not want the user to be required to install any software other than the extension itself. If a JS plugin would have made it way easier but required the user to install it out of band, it was eliminated as a candidate. This extension, first and foremost, must be easy to use.
